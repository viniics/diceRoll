# diceRoll

1st Week Learning Web Development, made this project all by myself, no tutorials.
Some bugs to be fixed and some functions to be implemented!


*Updates*

Version 1.1 -> The *play again* button calls the function 'reset()' and no longer reloads the page, which allows the user to keep the theme configuration, something that wasn't possible before
